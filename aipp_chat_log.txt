*   **Use a weather app:** There are many weather apps available for smartphones (e.g., WeatherBug, AccuWeather, Google Weather). These apps can provide current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather information for specific locations.
*   **Search on Google:** Simply search "weather in New Delhi" on Google. Google typically displays a weather summary at the top of the search results.
*   **Visit a weather website:** Websites like AccuWeather.com, Weather.com, or the India Meteorological Department (IMD) website often provide detailed weather information.

Intuitively, the covariance matrix generalizes the notion of variance to multiple dimensions. As an example, the variation in a collection of random points in two-dimensional space cannot be characterized fully by a single number, nor would the variances in the
